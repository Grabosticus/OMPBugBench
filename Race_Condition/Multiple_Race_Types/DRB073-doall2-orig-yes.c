Two-dimensional array computation using loops: missing private(j).
References to j in the loop cause data races.
Data race pairs (we allow multiple ones to preserve the pattern):
  Write_set = {j@61:10, j@61:20}
  Read_set = {j@62:20, j@62:12, j@61:14, j@61:20}
  Any pair from Write_set vs. Write_set  and Write_set vs. Read_set is a data race pair.
